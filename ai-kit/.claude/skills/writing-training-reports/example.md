**Today's notes from the user:**

> Worked on #12 Implement Database MCP Server: init server, resources database://connection, database://schema; sql tools list_database_tables, execute_sql_query. Learned: resources = read-only context for the model, tools = actions; keep SQL tools read-only to avoid unsafe queries. Branch feat/ecommerce, commit b69e476. Stuck: SQLite connection closes between tool calls, tried a connection pool, still failing. Anyone handled SQLite with async MCP servers? Tomorrow: cart and order tools. Tags: #practice
